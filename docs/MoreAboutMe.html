        <h1>More About Me</h1>
        <p>I am an 18 year old girl from Beaver County, Pa, which is about two hours south of Erie,Pa. I graduated from Hopewell Senior High School in May of 2024, 
           during these four years at Hopewell, I played softball. I started making game day posts for the softball team to post on the instagram page and everyone loved it.
           This is what sparked my interest in graphic design. Below are some posts that I created.</p>

        <p>Eventually I started to get noticed in the area for doing these game day posts for my high school softball team and during one of my interviews, I got asked about it. 
            Shortly after this interview was posted, I had other teams reaching out asking me to make them for their schools as well. Once my name started getting around I
            had local buisnesses asking me to make them new logos and help alter their websites. 
          
          Here is a link to the <a
              href="https://youtu.be/CqvyBd2fEsM?si=mVTF7fPGb_2jAWK8">interview</a> that helped me get noticed around the area, which led to me having many great opportunities.

        <h2>Outside of graphic design who am I?</h2>
        <p>I am a student athlete that deals with mental health issues that I try to advocate for and spread awareness to.</p>
            
         <p>How do I spread awareness towards mental health in athletes?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I have a suicide awareness ribbon on the back of my helmet</li>
            <li>I let people know it's okay not to be okay</li>
            <li>I voice when I am struggling so others don't feel alone if they are secretly fighting their own battles</li>
            <li>I make viral tiktok videos about student-athletes mental health and use my platform to grow awareness</li>
            <li>When I see people struggling I give them the same techniques I use and just be there for them.</li>
            <li>My glove is suicide awareness colors</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Below is five reasons why I spread awareness to this issue.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Around 50% of athletes aree reported to struggle with mental health</li>
            <li>In a 20 year span, 128 college athletes commited suicide</li>
            <li>In two months alone of 2022, five college athletes died by suicide</li>
            <li>There is a bag stigma around athletes regarding mental health because they are viewed as weak if they ask for help</li>
            <li>Around 1/3 of college athletes reported having high anxiety</li>
        </ol>
