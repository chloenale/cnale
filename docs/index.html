            Here is an article about my senior night game <a href="https://hopewellsportsnation.com/2024/04/29/hw-softball-wins-key-game-joining-top-four-in-section/">Senior Night Game</a>.</p>
        <p>It can be extremely exhausting being an <strong>athlete</strong> while trying to manage
            school at the same time.</p>
        <h2>What are some things student-athletes deal with?</h2>
        <p>There is a negative stigma student-atheltes face when it comes to their mental health. Below is a list of things student-athelets may face. </p>

            <li>burn outs</li>
            <li>low self-esteem</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Below is a list of ways I deal with these stressors since I'm more likely to experience them as a student-athlete.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Building my mental toughness</li>
            <li>Talking to a therapist specializing in athletes</li>
